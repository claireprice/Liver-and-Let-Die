## Overview

**Liver and Let Die** is an educational, browser-based **biochemistry quiz game** designed to teach concepts related to liver function, metabolism, and clinical biochemistry through interactive case-based learning.

Users are presented with a series of animated clinical cases and multiple-choice questions. As you progress through the narrative, correct answers help you advance while reinforcing your understanding of liver-related pathophysiology and diagnostic tests.
